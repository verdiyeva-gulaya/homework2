                <p>The coffee plant is native to Ethiopia. 
 Also in the 18th century people began growing coffee in Brazil. By the early 19th century coffee plantations in Brazil were booming. In the 20th century, a vast amount of coffee was grown in Uganda. 

                    During the Second World War coffee was rationed for a short time in the USA. Coffee rationing was introduced in November 1942 but it only lasted until July 1943. Today coffee is still one of the world's most popular drinks. Brazil is still the world's largest producer of coffee.</p>

                <p>Coffee supports happiness. People who consume coffee may simply have better underlying health than people who choose not to, says Peter Rogers, who studies the effects of caffeine on behaviour, mood, alertness and attention at the University of Bristol. That's in spite of their unhealthier lifestyle habits, as found in Gunter’s research.

                    “Some people suggested there might be protective effect, which is somewhat controversial as it’s based on population evidence.
                    
                    Meanwhile, people who consume coffee regularly often have higher blood pressure, which should increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. But, Rogers says, there isn’t evidence that higher blood pressure from drinking coffee is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical trials looking into coffee – which could better determine its benefits and risks – are rarer than population studies. But a group of researchers recently conducted a trial in which they observed the effects of drinking caffeinated coffee on blood sugar. The only thing coffee-drinkers need to be aware of, he says, is withdrawal. “Anyone who drinks a few cups of coffee a day is dependent on caffeine. If you took their coffee away, they’d be tired and would maybe have a headache.

                    These symptoms depend on how much coffee the person was drinking, but they usually last between three days and a week, in which time, caffeine is the only thing that will alleviate them.  </p>

                <p>A café is a type of restaurant which typically serves coffee and tea, in addition to light refreshments such as baked goods or snacks. The term "café" comes from the French word meaning "coffee".

                    A café setting is known as a casual social environment where you can find people reading newspapers and magazines, playing board games, studying or chatting with others about current events. It is known also regarded as a place where information can be exchanged.
                    
                    A café is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop or tea shop in English, a café in French and a bar in Italian. </p>
